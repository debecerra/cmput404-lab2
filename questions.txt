Question 1: We initialize a TCP socket with the method socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
Question 2: A client socket is returned when we accept a connection, and it allows us to send/receive messages to/from the application that initiated 
communication to the server. We can also create a client socket in the client application to connect to a server that is running. On the other hand, the
server socket is what we bind to a port so that so that the server can listen for client requests to connect. 
Question 3: We pass in the option socket.SO_REUSEADDR into the method socket.setsockopt(...)
Question 4: We get the IP address and port of the incoming connection
Question 5: The data that was sent by the client is returned by recv(). The server reads the text that was 
sent by calling recv(), then sends it back to the client, who receives the data similarily by calling recv().
